//This is FlameHud just edited by me (something like colours, health and ammo positions and other stuff i found cool)
//i wouldn't use it as Normal hud 
//The vaccinator is bugged and i dont know how to get rid off the 0% under the crosshair when in hand



//IF you want to change the colors of the hud for example Health go in /resource/ClientScheme (open it just like text file) and change the "Health Buff" and other colors with RGB colors

// It looks Like this --  0 102 204 255 --
//The first Number is Red (0-225).
//The Second Number is Green (0-255).
//The Third Number is Blue (0-255).
//The last number is alpha also 0-255 and alpha is basically how much will it be transparent - with 255 being not transparent, 0 being fully transparent(invisible).
