This is FlameHud just edited by me (something like colours, health and ammo positions and other stuff i found cool)
i wouldn't use it as Normal hud 
The vaccinator is bugged and i dont know how to get rid of the 0% under the crosshair when in hand



IF you want to change the colors of the hud for example Health go in /resource/ClientScheme (open it just like text file) and change the "Health Buff" and other colors
